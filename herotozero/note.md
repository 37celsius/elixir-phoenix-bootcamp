##### IEX
- 'i' command in iex is similar to typeof but more details, ie `x = 1 + 1` `i x` will spit result in details
- to concanate use <>, ie `"string 1" <> " string 3"` result `"string 1 string 3"`
- `Atoms` in Elixir is like a symbol, ie. `:ok`
- `Tupple` is like a list/ object in JS, `{1,2,"stuff"}`
- `Pipe Operator` whatever pass on to the next one is the first argument
- `IO.inspect` to see what's happening in the process, and you can put label on it, ie. `IO.inspect(label: "this is String.split()"`
